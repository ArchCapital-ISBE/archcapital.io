									<h3>Accel Resumes</h3>
									<p>Accel Resumes is currently Arch’s largest project, and it was developed completely in house! Accel is a resume writing, reviewing, and critiquing service that costs pennies on the dollar compared to its competitors - and for good reason. Accel targets those who haven’t yet entered the workforce but nowadays need more help than ever with their resumes: college students. That’s the main market, but not the only one! Within the coming months, we’ll be launching a huge marketing campaign to get Accel’s name out there to thousands of people across the country, and we can’t wait!</p>

									<h3>2U</h3>
									<p>2U is another proprietary business one hundred percent developed by Arch members. It aims to essentially be postmates on campus, but cheaper, more efficient, and all-around better. 2U looks to serve NU students looking for that late night snack while studying - we’ll be delivering food and drink from vendors located on Northwestern’s campus directly 2U! Keep your eyes out for it coming this Spring quarter!</p>

									<h3>Spark</h3>
									<p>Spark is Arch’s Facebook presence and aims to be Northwestern’s main resource for entrepreneurship. It contains not only entrepreneurship related articles, but also a forum that allows people to make connections that can help build a business, foster creative thinking, or find out about anything entrepreneurship related that’s happening at Northwestern!</p>

									<h3>Boom</h3>
									<p>Boom is a social media app out of UC - Santa Barbara that we’re inclined to believe will be the next big thing. Boom essentially is a location-based events app that allows people to anonymously (or not) share photos and videos to a feed that answers the age-old question of, “What’s going on tonight?” In this app you’ll see all kinds of events happening on and around campus - everything from parties to student group meetings to concerts!</p>

									<h3>Ussie</h3>
									<p>In today’s world of unrelenting pressures coming from social media, Ussie looks to be the social network that won’t have you preoccupied with getting likes or any sort of approval. Ussie is a group-centered app that allows groups of friends and family to directly share photos and other media with each other in a private, more comfortable manner.</p>
